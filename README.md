Hot Air Balloon Script for RedM This script allows players 
to buy, sell, and rent hot air balloons in an immersive and dynamic way. 
Players can purchase their own balloons, rent one . 
Perfect for roleplay servers looking to add a unique and scenic mode of transportation.

1 - Now, when you rent a hot air balloon, it is registered in the database for proper deletion. The timer continues even if you disconnect.

2 - When the server restarts, any rented balloons are deleted from the SQL database if present.

3 - A new config option has been added to set the spawn point of the balloon to prevent collisions and broken spawns.

4 - When the rental time is about to expire, the hot air balloon sends 3 notifications: one at 90 seconds, another at 60 seconds, and a final one at 30 seconds.

If you're using version 1, replace the entire script including the SQL.# Rs-Balloon-V2
